# MindPatch – Digital Detox & Wellness Planner

## Project Overview
MindPatch is an AI-assisted digital wellness and detox planner designed to help students maintain healthy digital habits and emotional well-being. The app focuses on gentle nudges, self-awareness, and habit-building rather than strict restrictions, making digital balance more approachable and sustainable for young users.

This project was developed as part of the **Critical & Creative Thinking – Summative Assessment** under the **Artificial Intelligence** course.

## Problem Statement
Students experience increasing digital fatigue, stress, and emotional imbalance due to prolonged screen usage. Many existing solutions are either too restrictive or lack emotional personalization. MindPatch addresses this gap by offering a calm, supportive, and user-centered wellness experience.

---

## Key Features
- **Mood Logging:** Simple mood tracking using emojis and sliders  
- **Screen-Time Input:** Manual input of daily screen usage  
- **AI Detox Planner (Simulated):** Rule-based personalized break suggestions  
- **Gratitude Journal:** Space for daily reflections  
- **Habit Tracker & Rewards:** Streaks and rewards to encourage healthy routines  

---

## AI Logic (Simulated)
MindPatch uses a simulated, rule-based AI logic to demonstrate decision-making.  
No real AI model or backend is implemented.

### Inputs:
- Mood score  
- Screen-time duration  
- Time of day  
- Habit consistency  

### Example Rules:
- If mood is low and screen time is high → suggest a longer break  
- If mood is neutral and screen time is moderate → suggest a short wellness activity  
- If mood is positive and screen time is low → provide positive reinforcement  

The system adapts suggestions over time based on user responses.

## User Testing & Iteration
The prototype was tested with a small group of users. Feedback highlighted that the app felt calm and supportive, and navigation was intuitive. Based on feedback, button labels were clarified, detox messages were simplified, and habit streak visibility was improved to enhance motivation.

---

## Ethical Considerations
- No personal or sensitive data collection  
- Manual user input only  
- No forced restrictions or guilt-based messaging  
- Focus on user autonomy, privacy, and emotional safety

## Tools Used
- **Figma:** Wireframes and high-fidelity interactive prototype  
- **Canva:** Research documentation, personas, and presentation  
- **GitHub:** Project hosting and documentation
